                                        There are <b>6 grams of fat</b> in an egg yolk. Most recipes for baked goods call for 2 or 3 eggs, so bye-bye to 12 to 18 grams of fat!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whenever a recipe calls for eggs, substitute 3 tablespoons of egg whites for each egg. Jumbo eggs have a lot more egg whites than large or medium eggs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>There are many ways to separate the yolks from the whites, but try this: Crack the egg gently on the side of a glass and then shift the yolk back and forth between two halves of the shell, letting the white fall into a bowl. When you separate a lot of eggs, you get good at it fast. </p>

                                    <p>
                                        When it comes to replacing oil or butter you have to divide baked goods into the bread or cookie kind to decide on the best substition.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When making bread or or muffins, use half fat-free yogurt and half unsweetened applesauce. For a lighter texture, use only applesauce. For a more dense texture, use just fat-free yogurt. The substitutions are inexpensive.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When making cookies use Prune Butter. It is super easy to make with a food processor. The recipe is below.

                                        Cooking sprays are considered fat-free, but in truth, they are not. In order to work as a releaser, they must contain 
                                        oil. If you spray a pan for 1/3 of a second, it is considered fat-free because the quantity sprayed us under half a gram of fat. 
                                        If you spray for 2-3 seconds, like most folks do, there can be as much as <a href="http://www.scientificpsychic.com/fitness/labels2.html" target="sprays">22 grams 
                                        of self-defeating fat.</a> The primary ingredient of the Cooking spray, which is marked with a note 'ADDS A TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF FAT' and the Nutrition Facts proclaim: Total Fat 0g.  Why?  
                                        Because the serving size has been defined to be a 1/3 second spray containing 0.266g of product. 
                                        Since this is less than half a gram (0.5g) per serving, it can be rounded to zero. 
                                        The line above the Nutrition Facts, states that 'A 1 SECOND SPRAY COVERS A 10" SKILLET'. 
                                        A one-second spray would contain approximately 0.8g of fat with 7 calories and would have to be reported on the Nutrition Facts. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Instead, use parchment paper, because it is not only fat-free, but very easy to use. 
                                        Lay it gently onto your bakware of choice, use scissors to cut diagonally into the 
                                        corners of a pan with sides, and then just overlap the paper cuts. 
                                        Parchment also makes it easy to remove the baked goodie from the pan and 
                                        and minimizes your clean-up. Finally, it's a good value because 
                                        it goes a long way — I bake something every weekend, 
                                        and it takes me 4 months to use an entire roll.</p>

                                    <p>Prune butter is one of the best replacements for oil or butter because it provides a wonderful texture to any baked goodie. It also adds a special flavor that makes the taster smile, usually followed by "WoW! This is sooooo good."
                                    </p><p>
                                        Prunes are dried plums. All you need is one small package, a tablespoon of any fruit juice, a spatula and a good food processor. Process them until it is smooth as chunky peanut butter. Tilt the food processor at different angles while it is running to speed up the process. If it is too stiff, add a teaspoon more of juice and process it for another minute.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Store prune butter in the fridge for up to 3 weeks, because a typical recipe uses only 2 - 3 tablespons. After you try this substitue you may find yourself with the desire to bake even more! </p>
                                    <p>Aside from the compliments you will get when you bake with prune butter, there is another big benefit from using it — it's really good for <a href="http://www.happyhealthylonglife.com/happy_healthy_long_life/2011/09/prunes_bones.html" target="prunes">keeping your bones strong.</a> </p>

                                        When a recipe calls for White Flour, don't hesitate to replace it with something healthier, such as Brown Rice flour (4.4g fat per Cup), or White Whole Wheat flour (2g fat per Cup), Whole Groat Buckwheat flour (3.7g fat per Cup). Even though these substitutes do add a few fat grams to a recipe that makes 24 servings, each serving will contain less than 1 gram of fat. Bob's Red Mill offers easy-to-find healthy replacements. Look for them in the baking aisle of your local grocery store.
