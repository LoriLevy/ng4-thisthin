                                        I love the fresh sweet flavors of mango salsa! There are many brands available, but this one  from La Mexicana is my favorite, and it is always fat-free. You can find it in <a href="http://lamexicanasalsa.com/where-to-buy/" target="salsa">these grocery stores</a> and it has a long fridge shelf-life.
